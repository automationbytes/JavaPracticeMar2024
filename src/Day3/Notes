Variable - Container to store some data in it

3 types

local variable - anything which is declared within the body of the method.
it can be accessed only within that method

instance variable - inside the class but outside the method. it will be declared as not static

static variable- variable which is declared with static keyword is called static variable

int age()
{
int a = 10;
}

===============================================
Static Keyword
==============
Used for memory management

When we hav the static keyword, it is belongs to class rather than instance of class (Object of class)

4 areas

1) Variable (class variable)
2) Methods
3) Block
4) Nested Class (not gonna use much)

It is used to save memory. (Efficient memory Management)


OOP's - Object Oriented Programming

Concept of using object in prg to implement real world entities.

Adv: clear syntax for our code ; easier to execute the code

Objects and class
(pillars of oops concept)
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation



class - student

datamembers - state/attr
name
age
phone num
email

methods -common - functionalty
-------
study()
eat()
practice()

class
Classs is collection of similar object
class is template (conceptual)
class without any obj
memory will not be allocated for class


object - instance of class
object is real
objects cant exist without class
when obj is init, obj wil hav their own memory


Inheritance
-----------
Inheritance is mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and features of another class.

The class that inherits the properties is called child class (sub class)
while the class from which the properties is inherited is classed parent class (super class)

keyword - extends

5 types of inheritance

single inheritance
multi-level inheritance
hierarchical inheritance
multiple inheritance (which not supported by java)
hybrid inheritance


single inheritance - > 1 parent 1 child
multilevel inheritance -> parent - child - grand child

Animal -> Dog -> Bull Dog

hierarchical inheritance - 1 parent multiple child
Animal
1) DOg
2) Cat


Hybrid inheritance - combination of more than 1
Animal
1) DOg - Bull Dog (multi lvel)
2) Cat
